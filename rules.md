# Hikes of the West

West of the Mississippi can be found some of the most impressive areas
of natural beauty and wonder. In order to experience these locations
to their fullest, it is necessary to get out of your car and go on a
hike. _Hikes of the West_ simulates three adventures across three
different locations.

## Setup

You will need:

* the 9-card deck of _Hikes of the West_ cards^[The final version will
  have 18 cards.] and
* 6 standard 6-sided dice.

Print the [cards](cards.pdf) either double-sided or single-sided in
order to insert into card sleeves.^[For the moment it does not matter
which front goes with which back.] Each card has a picture of a hiking
**location** on the front and a **path** on the back.

Shuffle the cards with the paths face up and flip over the top three
cards to their location side. These are the three hikes you will
complete.

## Planning stage

Each location includes a special rule for hiking there, so it pays to
plan your trip carefully.

Order the three locations from left to right. You must
complete the hikes in that order.

## Setting off

Flip the deck so that the location side of the cards is face up. Then
deal 2 cards with the path side up directly under the leftmost
location. Under those cards, deal three more to form the base of a
pyramid. Your hike will follow one of the three bottom path cards of
your choosing and then either of the two top path cards. Path cards
are dealt vertically and can be rotated in either direction.

> **Exception**: The Grand Canyon requires hiking from rim to rim. In
> this case deal the path in the form of a V. You may chose which side
> to start with, but there is no more choice of path until you reach
> the other rim.

You may roll all your free dice before choosing your starting
path. For the first location, you will have all 6 dice. Since you will
leave at least one die at each completed location, you will have fewer
dice on your second and third hike.

Before setting off, you may save one die as your **stamina**. The
stamina die works differently than other dice and it's usually best to
save a high number.

## Hiking

Each path includes 6 **terrains** marked with 1--6 pips. In order to
make progress on a path, you must **cover** each terrain spot _in
order_ with a matching die.

After each roll, you may cover as many terrain spots as you wish with
your available dice. After placing your dice, you may decide to
**roll** again or to **rest**.

If you are unable to place a die after rolling, you will be forced to
rest and lose any progress you made since the last rest stop.

> Example: The path ahead is 1---4---6---3 and you rolled
> 1,1,2,3,4,5. You may cover 1 and 4, but since you don't have a 6 you
> can't proceed without making a roll. You may decide to rest in order
> to save your progress or roll the remaining dice (1,2,3,5) in hopes
> of getting a 6 to proceed.
>
> Note: In this example, you could decide to save the 5 as stamina or
> chose not to save stamina in order to increase the odds of rolling a
> 6.

### Rolling again

If you decide to roll again, collect all the free dice. Do not pick up:

* Dice on the path
* Saved stamina dice
* Dice scored on a location

After you roll again, you must place at least one die (possibly
including saved stamina) to avoid a forced rest. If you cover at least
one terrain spot, you may chose to continue or to rest at the furthest
spot you covered.

### Using stamina

If you have a stamina die available, you may use it to cover and
terrain that is _less then or equal to_ the stamina die. This means a
6 stamina die acts as a wild to cover any terrain.

Once you use your stamina, you may not replace it until you rest
again. You may not reroll stamina after saving it until you rest and
you may not save stamina during a rest. Add any saved stamina dice to
the first roll after a rest.

### Resting

If you are forced to rest, remove all the dice you placed since the
last rest and increase the rest die by one.

If you choose to rest, set the furthest die along the path to the
number of rests you've taken in that location. For the first rest, set
it to 1. For subsequent rests set it one higher than the number on the
previous rest location. Then remove all the other dice on the path
(including the previous rest location).

> Note: If the previous rest location was 6, set that die on the
> location card and start the next rest at 1. That die counts against
> your final score and is no longer available to use for rolling or
> covering terrain.

Add the dice taken off the path and any saved stamina to roll
again. You may save stamina from this first roll after a rest. Proceed
on the path.

### Completing a path card

With the exception of the Grand Canyon, you may chose which card to
continue on when you cover the top-most terrain the first card. If you
lose progress and go back to a rest stop on the first card, you may
chose either path after resting.

If you finish the final card, move the die from the last rest stop to
the location card. It counts against your final score and can no
longer be used for rolling or covering terrain. 

After completing a location, gather up the location cards, shuffle
them all again and lay out the path cards for the next location. For
the first roll of the next location, you may save off stamina as you
are assumed to be well rested when you arrive at the trail head.

## Game end

When you complete the third and final hike, add up the dice you placed
on the location cards. This is your final score. Lower is better as in
golf.

Each location has a par value. (See below.) If your score is less than
or equal to the sum of the three pars.

# Location reference

| Location         | Special rule                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Par |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----:|
| Mt. Rainier      | Do not place any dice or re-roll after using stamina to cover terrain. The spot you covered with stamina is the new rest stop.                                                                                                        |   5 |
| Great Sand Dunes | Immediately after saving stamina, reduce the value of the stamina die by one.                                                                                                                                                         |   5 |
| Joshua Tree      | 6s can not be saved as stamina.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |   5 |
| Pipestone        | Dice may cover terrain if they are greater than or equal to the terrain number. In other words, all dice act like stamina dice for the purposes of make progress on the path. You may save one die after a rest as stamina, as usual. |   3 |
| Black Hills      | If you roll three or more dice with the same number, you are forced rest and lose any progress you might have made since the last rest.                                                                                               |   4 |
| Cedar Breaks     | Instead of won stamina die, you may save two stamina dice after a rest.                                                                                                                                                               |   3 |
| Grand Canyon | Lay out the path cards in the form of a V. Easiest is to start with a horizontal path representing the Colorado River and then put two vertical paths on each side to represent the North and South Rims. You may chose which side to start with, but once you start, you must finish the hike along the path.  | 9 |
| Pikes Peak       | Instead of hiking as normal, you may decide to ride to the top at the cost of 5 rests. Immediately place on die with 5 facing up on the location card and move on. Once you decide to start hiking, you may not change your mind.     |   4 |

Notes:

* The card text includes a summary of the special rule. When in doubt,
  refer to the above table.
* Par is an estimated difficulty based on play testing. It's possible,
  likely even, that these values fail to reflect the actual
  difficultly of each location. Please let me know if you think I'm wrong!
